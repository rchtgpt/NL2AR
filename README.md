## Overview

SpeakAR is a mobile application powered by Natural Language Processing and 3D Generative AI. This state-of-the-art application transforms human speech into captivating 3D models that are seamlessly integrated into the real world through augmented reality. With speakAR, you can bring your words to life and immerse yourself in a world of interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understands a vast array of natural language descriptions and converts into text that can be fed into our 3D diffusion models

- **3D Diffusion Model:** Uses advanced algorithms to generate 3D models of the inputted speech and ensures conversion from text to 3D is accurate, smooth, and free from distortions.

- **Augmented Reality (AR) Integration:** Overlay the generated 3D visuals onto the real world for an immersive experience.

- **Interactive 3D Models:** Interact with the created 3D assets, rotate them, zoom in/out, and even animate them.

## How to Use

1. **Launch the App:** Tap on the `speakAR` icon on your device.
2. **Speak or Type:** Describe the image you want to visualize in natural language.
3. **Instant Visualization:** Watch as your description is instantly converted into a 3D model.
4. **AR Mode:** Activate the AR mode to overlay the 3D model onto your surroundings.
5. **Interact:** Use touch or gesture controls to interact with the image, such as rotating or animating it.
